Idea comes from elevator, but each level design to a new crazy world.
# The Demons 13 Floors
The sound of *Pathetique, Op. 13* echoes in the air, endlessly weaving through joy, sorrow, and chaos.  

A mysterious 13th floor has appeared in the elevator.  

Alice, a witch, who has **13 lives**, has been tasked with investigating the terrifying disappearances related to the elevator.  

However, as the elevator ascends, it pulls Alice further and further away from reality, one floor at a time.  

Perhaps, by defeating the dreadful 13 number demons on each floor, she can escape this nightmare once she reaches the 13th floor.  

But... is that really possible?

## How to Play
Dodge enemy bullets and defeat them. Do not let them hit your heart. Defeat all demons before 13 life points are consumed. 
- ⬅: Move Left
- ➡: Move Right
- ⬆: Move Up
- ⬇: Move Down
- Shift: Move Slow
- Escape: Pause The Game


## Tips
- *Shift* is very useful, moving slow and show the **Red Point** which you only need to focus.
- Each time you hit bosses, will get 1 score, every **130 score** will get a new life point.
- Each time you loss life point, you will in god-time 3s, moving wherever you want.

### The game looks hard, but it is easy. Welcome, and, Have fun!
